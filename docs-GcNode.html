    <h2><i>Abstract class</i></h2>
    <p>The most basic implementation of the TrackController interface, and the type from which most others inherit. Is not meant to be instanced. Exists as a common base type allowing different subtypes and external classes to access and communicate with each other. Most often used for parameter and return typing.</p>
